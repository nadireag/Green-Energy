### Description:

Renewable energy is energy that comes from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, plants, waves and geothermal heat. These energy resources are renewable, meaning they are naturally replenished.

The major types of renewable energy sources: Biomass, Hydropower, Geothermal, Wind and Solar.

### Questions:

* Which states are using the most renewable energy?

* Total energy consumption vs. renewable energy potential by State: Can a State’s potential meet their consumption?

* Types of renewable energy by highest potential: Which types account for the most potential? By State?

## Analysis

* Clean and modify the data using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.

* Use Heroku and PostgreSQL as the database.

* Use Python as the server side language, Flask as the web server and SQLAlchemy as the ORM.

* Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front end.

* Use D3, Plotly, Chart.js and Leaflet to visualize the data.
